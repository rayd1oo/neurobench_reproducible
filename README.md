# neurobench_reproducible blog requirements
Project Deadline: before Monday 15 April 2024.
All groups should write a blog post describing the method, the steps taken and the results of their reproduction.

1.Upload your code and blog post to Github / Gitlab.

2.Submit your work to the website [https://reproducedpapers.org]: Submit your reproduction together with the URL which links to your blog and the URL that links to your code. If you wish, you can set your submission to "private". During grading we will check if the blog and the code exist.

3.Submit a PDF version of your blog before the deadline on Brightspace. This is used for grading, so please make the blog self-contained. We may also check your code if we think this is needed, but the blog should be readable and understandable without going through all your code. Please add your names, contact and studentIDs on the first page. Also include a clear overview of which group member did what.

4.Please also send your blog post and code to both your MSc TA, as well as your external supervisor.

There are multiple criteria for reproducing a paper.The two main options are: 

Full re-implementation: Implemented the paper contribution without using pre-existing code. This will pass the project without any extra work needed.

Existing code: Replicate an existing code implementation. Additional criteria will be required. Please consult with your TA and see below.

When you submit your reproduction, you can select multiple criteria, each person should at least be responsible for 1 criteria:

Reproduced: Existing code was evaluated.

Hyperparams check: Evaluating sensitivity to hyperparameters.

New algorithm variant: Evaluating a slightly different variant.

New code variant: Rewrote or ported existing code to be more efficient/readable.

In your submission make clear which criteria you used, and why. Each submission should briefly list what each person contributed (few lines).
